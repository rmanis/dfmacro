This is a utility for building macro files for Dwarf Fortress.

There are two scripts: df.pl and dfcomp.pl

df.pl will probably do everything you need.  The thing that makes
dfcomp different is you can define and call procedures in your macros,
but it requires that Parse::RecDescent is installed.

Both scripts read in their configuration (what symbols do what) from
keys.pl.  They read in a macro from standard input and output in the
format that Dwarf Fortress can use to standard output.

The first line of input should be the name of the macro.  The rest of
the file is a sequence of commands that are defined in keys.pl.

To use, do something like the following:

 $ ./df.pl < quarters > quarters.mak

or if you want to use procedures,

 $ ./df.pl < testmacro > testmacro.mak
